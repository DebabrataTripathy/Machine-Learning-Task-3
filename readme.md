In this Internship,I have  made  Student grade prediction model based on various student's data
Libraries used:-
-numpy
-sklearn
-pandas
-matplotlib.pyplot

-I have Added a column named 'final_grade' ,which is the sum of columns(G1,G2,G3)
-After that I encoded binary and nomial data by using LabelEncoder,OneHotEncoder & ColumnTransformer from sklearn library
-I split the dataset into training and testing data
-Then  used Regression and Random forest regressor machine learning models
- I calculated some important results (scores) like:-
-Train score
-Test score
-Prediction score
 
-Then I performed  backward elimination which extracted the features which affect 'final_grade' the most.
-then plotted boxplots showing how the extracted  features affected 'final_grade'
-Then i built a random forest regressor by using the extracted  featues and calculated their various scores 

-Some Important insights:-
